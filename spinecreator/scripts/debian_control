# Create the correct control file
# Figure out the dependencies using:
# objdump -p /path/to/${PROGRAM_NAME} | grep NEEDED
# And for each line dpkg -S library.so.X
#
# NB: I'll add Brahms to the Recommends line, when I've created a
# debian package for it. Or perhaps these would be best in Depends?
#
# extra libs? libgvc6 perhaps. Not perfectly sure of graphviz-dev
# version that we have to be greater than. approx 2.32.
#
# Dependencies will be some of:
# qtdeclarative5-dev, qtdeclarative5-dev-tools, libqt5declarative5,
# qtquick1-5-dev, qtscript5-dev, libqt5svg5-dev, qttools5-dev-tools,
# qttools5-dev, libqt5opengl5-dev, qtquick1-qml-plugins
