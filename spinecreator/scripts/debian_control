# Create the correct control file
# Figure out the dependencies using:
# objdump -p /path/to/${PROGRAM_NAME} | grep NEEDED
# And for each line dpkg -S library.so.X
#
# NB: I'll add Brahms to the Recommends line, when I've created a
# debian package for it. Or perhaps these would be best in Depends?
#
# extra libs? libgvc6 perhaps. Not perfectly sure of graphviz-dev
# version that we have to be greater than. approx 2.32.
#
# Dependencies will be some of:
# qtdeclarative5-dev, qtdeclarative5-dev-tools, libqt5declarative5,
# qtquick1-5-dev, qtscript5-dev, libqt5svg5-dev, qttools5-dev-tools,
# qttools5-dev, libqt5opengl5-dev, qtquick1-qml-plugins

Description:  GUI for SpineML.
 Create, visualise and simulate neural network models. SpineCreator makes it
 possible to lay out a neural network model with boxes and arrows signifying
 the neural populations and connections. A flexible component editors allows
 arbitrary models to be used for each neural element. SpineCreator is commonly
 used to lay out rate-coded, leaky integrate-and-fire and Izhikevich spiking
 neural networks. SpineCreator writes the model into an XML format called
 SpineML, which is an extension to the INCF standard format NineML.
 If a compatible simulator is available (for example spineml-2-brahms) then
 models can be executed and the results viewed with the built-in graphing
 functionality.
