Name brahms

Description

BRAHMS is a Modular Execution Framework (MEF) for executing integrated
systems built from component software processes (a SystemML-ready
execution client). Its operation is conceptually similar to that of
Simulink. Such tools allow the connection of processes together into
systems, by linking the outputs of some processes into the inputs of
others.

BRAHMS is used by computational neuroscience and robotics researchers.
