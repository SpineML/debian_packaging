Description: SpineML to BRAHMS execution backend
 Code generation scripts for transforming a SpineML neural model into
 a running BRAHMS system. This includes XSL scripts to convert a
 SpineML model into SystemML format with compiled components. The
 scripts convert SpineML component XML into C++ code which is then
 compiled into shared object code. Converts SpineML network and
 experiment XML into the SystemML XML. Finally, the simulation is
 executed.
