Description

BRAHMS is a Modular Execution Framework (MEF) for executing integrated
systems built from component software processes (a SystemML-ready
execution client). Its operation is conceptually similar to that of
Simulink. Such tools allow the connection of processes together into
systems, by linking the outputs of some processes into the inputs of
others.

BRAHMS is used by computational neuroscience and robotics researchers.

  Description     : Convert SpineML models for execution in brahms

spineml-2-brahms is a set of scripts which takes a neural network
model described in the SpineML format (an XML format) and creates the
components necessary to execute the model using the BRAHMS modular
execution framework (http://brahms.sourceforge.net/home/).

XSL scripts take the SpineML input and generate C++ Brahms component
source code files. These files are compiled by spineml-2-brahms
convert script.
